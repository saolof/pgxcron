# Slight hack: to avoid committing a password to repo,
# each configured db may specify a password var, which is the
# name of the environment variable used to inject the password.
# This is substituted in instead of the first occurrent of $password

# Alternatively, if pgpass is available, the underlying pgx library
# can rely on that instead using the standard postgres environment variables:
# https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jackc/pgx/v5@v5.5.5/pgconn#ParseConfig
# In that case, you may write justusepgpass=true to strip the :$password
# from the connstring

[example]
connstring="postgresql://admin:$password@exampleurl.net:5432/postgres"
justusepgpass=true
passwordvar="EXAMPLE_PASS"
